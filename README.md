# Before you Begin

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the software’s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

This is a sample app demonstrating java sdk integration with CF 

## To use this application, follow the steps as below ##

1) Create a project in Harness with Feature-flags module enabled
2) Create an environment within your project
3) Create a server-side sdk key in your environment **COPY the value from the Admin Console to your clipboard since this value will only be displayed once**
4) Create a boolean feature-flag in the admin console
5) Import the maven project in an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
6) Replace the values for SDK Key and feature-flag identifier in the example program from step 3 and 4
7) Run the program from the IDE

We are using the java sdk jar as dependency for this sample program
``` 
            <dependency>
                <groupId>io.harness</groupId>
                <artifactId>ff-java-server-sdk</artifactId>
                <version>1.1.0</version>
            </dependency>
